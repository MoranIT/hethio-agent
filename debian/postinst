# This script typically completes any required configuration of the package 
# foo once foo has been unpacked from its Debian archive (".deb") file. Often, 
# 'postinst' scripts ask the user for input, and/or warn the user that if he 
# accepts default values, he should remember to go back and re-configure that 
# package as the situation warrants. Many 'postinst' scripts then execute any 
# commands necessary to start or restart a service once a new package has been 
# installed or upgraded.
#

# Rename service file to match agent executable
mv /etc/init.d/hethio /etc/init.d/hethio-agent

# Create configuration path
mkdir -p /etc/hethio

# Add hethio at startup
update-rc.d hethio-agent defaults

# Start our service
/etc/init.d/hethio-agent start
