# Minion-API
Minions are Raspberry Pi's configured to run a series of roles all controlled by the main minion website.  This API is the one directly installed on the Pi devices.

## Installing the Minion-API Website
Now that you've setup your Raspberry Pi with a webbrowser and PHP capabilities, it's time to install this api for even more fun!

>$ wget https://github.com/danielheth/minion-api/tarball/master

>$ tar -xpvf master

>$ cd danielheth*


### Brand New Minions
If this is a brand new Pi which you just installed the Raspbian OS, run the following:
